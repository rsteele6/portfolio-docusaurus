## Description

This is a user guide for my employer's dev portal, covering all features and functionality. It's continually updated as required.

## Problem

My employer, a Boston-area software company, previously did not have user documentation for its dev portal. The portal allows developers to request sandbox/production access to the company's product, reset client secrets, and view documentation. As a result, customer service and support staff were fielding redundant questions via email and support tickets.

## Contribution

I worked with internal developers, SMEs, and marketing specialists to draft the first iteration of a comprehensive user manual covering all features. This is a living document that is updated by all members of the docs team as new releases come out.

## Impact

Support tickets and emails with routine questions regarding the portal were reduced, and the company received several complements from customers, including one which stated, "This is exactly what we needed!"
