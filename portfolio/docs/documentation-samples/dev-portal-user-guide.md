## Description

This user guide documents all features and functionalities of my employer's dev portal, with continuous updates as needed.

## Problem

Previously, my employer, a Boston-area software company, lacked user documentation for its dev portal. The portal enables developers to request sandbox and production access to the companyâ€™s product, reset client secrets, and access documentation. In the absence of formal documentation, customer service and support staff handled numerous repetitive inquiries via email and support tickets.

## Contribution

I collaborated with internal developers, subject matter experts (SMEs), and marketing specialists to draft the first version of a comprehensive user manual covering all portal features. This is a living document, updated by the documentation team with each new release.

## Impact

The guide significantly reduced routine support tickets and email inquiries about the portal. Customers responded positively, with one remarking, "This is exactly what we needed!"

## Technologies Used
