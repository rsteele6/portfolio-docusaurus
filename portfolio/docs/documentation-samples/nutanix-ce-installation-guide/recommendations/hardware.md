## Cluster Sizing

Community Edition supports up to four (4) nodes in a single cluster. Nutanix recommends deploying a three-node cluster to reap the most benefit from the platform. If you deploy a single node cluster, you will not be able to take advantage of Nutanixâ€™s high-availability (HA) features.

:::danger[You can't extend a one or two node cluster]

Moving from a one or two node cluster requires destroying the existing cluster and all VMs. Discuss these limitations with the customer before recommending a cluster size.
