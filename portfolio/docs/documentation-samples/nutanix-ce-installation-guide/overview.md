# Overview

This field installation guide was created for a fictitious Managed Services Provider (MSP), RS Tech Services, to assist field engineers in deploying Nutanix Community Edition at customer sites quickly and efficiently, reducing the need for calls to senior technical staff.

## Description

Designed for RS Tech Services, this installation guide helps field engineers streamline initial deployments of Nutanix Community Edition, a software-defined hyper-converged platform that integrates storage, computing, and virtualization. The Community Edition, a free version of Nutanix, is intended for testing and non-production purposes.

## Problem

In this scenario, RS Tech Services faced recurring customer complaints due to configuration errors made by field personnel during installation. Troubleshooting these issues was also challenging and time-intensive because field technicians were not consistently producing as-built documentation, leading to project delays.

## Solution

To address these issues, I developed a comprehensive installation guide, including a network information checklist that technicians could use to complete as-built documentation.

## Impact

The guide enabled technicians to perform standardized deployments while reducing human error. All system IPs, usernames, and passwords were documented before technicians left the customer site, resulting in a 40% decrease in installation-related support calls within 90 days of the guide's release.

## Technologies Used

- Microsoft Word
