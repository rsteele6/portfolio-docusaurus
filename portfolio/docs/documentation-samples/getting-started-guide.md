## Description

This is a re-vamp of my employer's Getting Started Guide, used to acclimate new customers with my employer's API products.

## Problem

The previous version of the Getting Started Guide contained over seven steps and included numerous links to tangential resources, creating confusion for its intended audience—developers new to the company’s products. These developers simply wanted to place a few API calls to explore product functionality. As a result, many support tickets were submitted by developers unable to complete the steps in the guide.

## Contribution

I collaborated with internal developers, product managers, and subject matter experts (SMEs) to streamline the guide from over seven steps to three, removing unneeded links, adding relevant code samples, and linking to three interactive apps on CodeSandbox to support each step.

Additionally, I introduced a test scenario at the beginning of the guide and maintained this scenario throughout, helping developers understand both the context and purpose of each step.

## Impact

The updated guide reduced support tickets related to onboarding, and customer developers provided positive feedback, noting that the interactive, follow-along approach was a significant improvement.

## Technologies Used

- Confluence
- Readme
- CodeSandbox
