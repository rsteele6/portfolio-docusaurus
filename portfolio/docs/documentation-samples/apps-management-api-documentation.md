## Description

This is a user guide, migration guide, and specification document for my employer's App Management API.

## Problem

My employer, a Boston-area software company released a new version of its Apps Management API and needed several guides and an OpenAPI specification document. Developers generated the spec, but it needed proofreading and further refinement. We had a tight deadline to produce the documents needed.

## Contribution

I assisted the documentation lead in drafting and proofreading the user guide and migration guide. I worked with subject matter experts (SMEs) to refine the OpenAPI specification document using Spotlight, and published all documentation in Readme in time for the API release.
