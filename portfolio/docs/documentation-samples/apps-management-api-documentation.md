## Description

This document serves as a user guide, migration guide, and specification for my employerâ€™s Apps Management API.

## Problem

My employer, a Boston-area software company, released a new version of its Apps Management API and required multiple guides along with an OpenAPI specification document. Although developers generated the initial specification, it needed proofreading and further refinement. Additionally, we faced a tight deadline for completing the documentation.

## Contribution

I supported the documentation lead by drafting and proofreading the user and migration guides. I collaborated with subject matter experts (SMEs) to refine the OpenAPI specification document using Spotlight and published all documentation in ReadMe, meeting the release deadline for the API.

## Technologies Used
