# Overview

This document is an OpenAPI spec I created for a [Node.js REST API](./../../programming-projects/states-api.md) developed as a final project for a backend development course. The API allows users to retrieve, add, update, and delete data points about individual U.S. states or all states.

## Description

I built a Node.js API as part of a backend development course. Following the project, I created an OpenAPI 3.1 specification document to showcase my skills in API documentation and specification.

The API supports operations to retrieve, add, update, and delete information about one or more U.S. states. Data was stored in a MongoDB database hosted on Heroku, and responses are returned in JSON format.
