# Overview

This is a spec document I created for a [Node.js REST API](./../../programming-projects/states-api.md) I built as a final project for a backend dev course. The API enables you to retrieve, add, update and delete specific data points about a single US state, or all of them.

## Description

I created an API in Node.js (deployed in Heroku) for a backend dev course. Afterward, I decided to create an OpenAPI 3.1 specification document for it to practice and demonstrate my skills in this area.

The API allows users to retrieve, add, update, and delete data about one or more US states. All data is stored in a MongoDB database hosted by Heroku. Responses are returned in JSON.
