> ― Krista Van Laan, The Insider's Guide to Technical Writing

I'm a technical writer specializing in the software/IT space. I leverage over 15 years of experience in technical support and systems administration to inform the documentation I produce, which includes installation/user guides, quick reference guides, release notes, and more.

My background provides me with a user-centric approach to everything I write. I have a passion for creating documentation that provides users with the best experience possible while helping them learn a thing or two along the way.

This site showcases recent projects to demonstrate my writing style and skills. Some projects were created for an employer in my capacity as a technical writer for the organization. Others were developed entirely on my own.
